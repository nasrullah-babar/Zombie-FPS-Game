# Zombie Survival FPS (Unreal Engine 5)

**A fast-paced first-person zombie survival shooter built in Unreal Engine 5.**  
Survive against escalating waves of zombies using responsive gunplay, smart positioning, and survival strategy.

This project functions as both a **playable FPS prototype** and a **portfolio-ready academic project**, developed as part of an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course.

---

## Academic Context

This game was created as a **course project for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with a focus on applying OOP principles such as:
- Classes and objects  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Encapsulation and modular design  
- Separation of gameplay systems  

These concepts were implemented using **C++ and Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints**.

---

## Gameplay Overview

Players are placed in a combat arena and must survive **increasingly difficult waves of zombies**. Each wave increases enemy count and challenge, requiring efficient ammo management, movement, and positioning.

Core gameplay focuses on:
- Responsive first-person shooting  
- Clear combat feedback  
- Progressive difficulty scaling
